#### 오라클 고급함수

데이터를 분석하는 기능을 가진 함수
순위함수 : RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), FIRST, LAST를 사용한 분석법
분석함수를 사용하기 위한 구문 형식
분석함수(p1, p2, ...) OVER(partition BY , ORDER BY)

```sql
--RANK 함수(순위가 같은 값만큼 다음 순위에 영향을 미침 1,2,2,4...)
--급여별 순위
SELECT employee_id, salary, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) RANKING_SALARY
FROM employees;

--DENSE RANK 함수(1,2,2,3...)
SELECT 
employee_ide, 
salary, 
RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) ranking1,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) ranking2
FROM employees;

--ROW_NUMBER 함수(정렬 순서대로 부여)
SELECT 
employee_id,
salary,
RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) ranking1,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) ranking2,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) ranking3
FROM employees;

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC)
WHERE rownum < 11;

--분석함수는 SELECT 절에서만 사용 가능
SELECT employee_id, salary,
       row_number() over (ORDER BY salary DESC) ranking
FROM employees
WHERE row_number() over (ORDER BY salary DESC) <11;


SELECT employee_id, salary,
       row_number() over (ORDER BY salary DESC) ranking
FROM employees
WHERE rownum < 11;

--부서별 급여가 상위 3위에 해당되는 사원의 이름과 부서를 출력하는 예
SELECT tbl.* 
FROM (SELECT department_id, last_name,
             row_number() over (partition BY department_id
                                ORDER BY salary DESC) sal
      FROM employees) tbl
WHERE tbl.sal <=3;


--first, last 분석함수에서 사용되는 키워드
--구문 형식 
--집계함수 keep (dense_rank first[last] ORDER BY ...) 
-- over(partition BY ..)

SELECT  department_id, max(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY department_id;

SELECT  department_id, min(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY department_id;


--부서별 최대급여와 최소 급여를 받는 사원의 명단을 추출
